# PM3UniversalGUI
Proxmark3 automated GUI proxy tool

PM3UniversalGUI works with proxmark3.exe console client to display help output in an easier-to-navigate view.

It tries to parse help outputs of each command reported by proxmark3.exe, which, however, are largely inconsistent, thereby making it impossible to interpret it correctly. Efforts are made to understand most common outputs and variations, covering ~70% of the commands

## Installation

Place PM3UniversalGUI release files https://github.com/burma69/PM3UniversalGUI/tree/master/PM3UniversalGUI/bin/Release into the same folder with proxmark3.exe. Alternatively, you can modify PM3UniversalGUI.exe.config XML file and specify the exact location of proxmark3.exe
